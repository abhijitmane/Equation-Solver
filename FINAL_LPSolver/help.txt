Helping Instructions for LPSolver:-
a)Problem Format : 
	  declarations: a,b,c
	  min: 8a+5b+4c
	  subject_to:
		4a+2b+8c=12
        	7a+5b+6c>=9
        	8a+5b+4c<=10
        	3a+7b+9c>=7
	  restrictions: a>=0;c<=0
   NOTE: 
   	 1.declarations: & variable names must be on single line
   	 2.Objective function min:/max: C1X1+C2X2+.... must be on single line
	 3.Only 'subject_to:' statement statement should be on single line(No any constraint)
	 4.After subject_to, for all constraints, one constraint should be on one line
	 5.For variable restrictions, restrictions statement is followed by variable restrictions 
	      variables with >= or <= rest. will be like a,b,c,d>=0 then ;(semicolon) is a seprator. Then next <= or >= rest. like e,f,g<=0
  	      semicolon(;) must be used as separator for <= & >= rests. & ,(coma) is used as separator for variables (eg. a,b>=0; c,d<=0;)
	      Absent variable will be considered as unrestricted.
